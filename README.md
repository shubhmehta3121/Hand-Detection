This Python script utilizes OpenCV and the cvzone.HandTrackingModule to perform real-time hand detection in a live camera feed and subsequently crop the area around the detected hand. This project serves as a foundational example, ideal for kickstarting various applications involving hand tracking and gesture recognition.
